# Technical Decisions & Implementation Details

## Architecture Overview

The orders system is built with performance and scalability in mind, utilizing:
- Next.js for the application framework
- Prisma for type-safe database access
- React Query for efficient data fetching
- React Virtual for performant list rendering
- PostgreSQL for the database

## Performance Optimizations

### API Layer
1. **Cursor-based Pagination**
   - More efficient than offset pagination for large datasets
   - Maintains consistent performance as data grows
   - Uses compound indexes for optimal query performance

2. **Query Optimization**
   - Parallel execution of count and data queries
   - Selective field fetching
   - Proper indexing strategy
   - Response caching with appropriate headers

### Frontend Layer
1. **Virtualization**
   - Only renders visible rows
   - Maintains smooth scrolling with large datasets
   - Optimized overscan for better UX

2. **Data Management**
   - Efficient caching with React Query
   - Optimistic updates for sorting
   - Debounced search/filter operations
   - Memoized computations for derived data

## Known Limitations

1. **Sorting Limitations**
   - Complex sorts might impact performance
   - Limited to single-field sorting
   - Some edge cases with cursor pagination during sorts

2. **Data Volume**
   - Optimal for datasets up to 1M records
   - May need additional optimization for larger datasets

## Future Improvements

1. **Performance**
   - Implement Redis caching layer
   - Add materialized views for complex queries
   - Implement request compression

2. **Features**
   - Multi-column sorting
   - Advanced filtering
   - Real-time updates
   - Export functionality
